  # Fix for pstoedit search for plugins, thereby restoring formats that
  # worked in 3.62 but now don't in 3.70, including PIC, DXF, FIG, and
  # many others.
  #
  # This patch has been submitted upstream; see:
  # https://sourceforge.net/p/pstoedit/bugs/19/
  #
  # Taken from:
  # https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/openSUSE:Factory/pstoedit/pstoedit-pkglibdir.patch?expand=1
  #
  # This patch changes the behavior of "make install" so that:
  # * If common/plugindir is defined, it checks only that directory.
  # * It swaps the check order: First checks whether PSTOEDITLIBDIR exists. If
  #   it exists, it skips blind attempts to find plugins.
  # As PSTOEDITLIBDIR is always defined by makefile, the blind fallback will
  # be attempted only in obscure environments.
