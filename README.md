# SoftWare AGgregated and Organized (SWAGO)
The SoftWare AGgregated and Organized (SWAGO) is an open source search engine designed for software package search specifically. It was the result of a year-long project in [Berkeley's Master of Engineering Program Capstone](https://funginstitute.berkeley.edu/programs-centers/full-time-program/capstone-experience/).
