# SoftWare AGgregated and Organized (SWAGO)
This branch contains scripts for experimentation before the data was indexed. Also contains scripts used to scrape and index queries from Slant.co. For more information on the ranking algorithm, look at files inside the SOLR/solr-7.2.0 folder of the indexer branch. Check out [Solr Cookbook](https://github.com/vivianbuan/Search-Engine-for-Software/blob/indexer/docs/solr_cookbook.md) for instruction on how to set up solr server for the project and how to set up ranker on top of indexer.
